# Purpose

USB Type-C Connector System Software Interface (UCSI) defines the commands and notifications to manage a platform that exposes one or more USB Type-C connectors. The combination of hardware and firmware and any vendor-provided OS software that provides this interface is referred to as the Platform Policy Manager or the PPM. UCSI PPM is typically implemented by an Embedded Controller (EC) which may either implement Power Delivery (PD) state machines or interface a PD controller. 
STMicroelectronics interfaces with STM32G0 over the I2C physical transport.

Here is an example of architecture between a STM32M135 MPU (OPM) and STM32G0 Device (PPM/LPM):
